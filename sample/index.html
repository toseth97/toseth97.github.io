               I am an Entry-level IT support professional / web developer seeking a full-time role in Information Technology and web development. Recently completed the Google IT Support Professional Certificate — an eight-month IT support program that covers troubleshooting, customer service, networking, operating systems, system administration, and security, and includes hands-on labs.

            <div class="web_dev_paragraph">
                <p>Being into Web development has helped me to see the IT world in a whole new way. I for once started HTML in 2017, which one of my friends who is a mobile app developer (Sodiq Oladeni) encouraged me to learn, but I wasn't patient enough, and also, I wasn't ready to learn. This made the whole process hard for me, I could not assimilate a thing and neither do I understand as well so I dropped it. I went on with my IT career in networking and system administration.
                 Not until late September 2021 that I unconsciously and willing develop an interest in web development. It is now about 2 months that I am in web development, I am comfortable using HTML and CSS. What drives me and what made me learn web dev more this time is that I see web dev as a game, and I love games so this helped me enjoy web development. So I ensure that I devote daily time to it and I also learn to learn smart.
                 I am on <span class = "text_focus">Google project management Certification</span> course 4 of the Google project management Certification on Coursera, and I learned that setting milestones and deadlines is vital. so I decided to set a realistic goal for myself on my web development path.
                 I told myself that in <span class = "text_focus">SIX MONTH</span>,i should be ready to take on a job in web development. <span class="text_focus">Chris Sean</span>  said in one of his youtube videos that <em>as a web developer, you might not necessarily need to know all syntax off-hand, but you need to know how they work and also you need to be a person who is familiar with <span class="text_focus">Google</span></em> and also, persistency is a key to move with, and that is absolutely true.
                 <span class = "text_focus">I am looking for communities that can help me grow more in this field because i am passionate about it.</span>
