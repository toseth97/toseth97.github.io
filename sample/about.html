                <p>I have loved computers and their application ever since I was little, I remembered when I was in primary (elementary) school, we use to have a vacuum tube television and I always wanted to know what's working inside and how it was working........ I will open the television to find the depth of what is going on inside like I really want to know where the images are coming from. Then my elder brother bought his first laptop, it was a Pentium 4 Dell laptop back then, I also wanted to know what happens inside, so I did the usual, I opened it as well and I saw a mother-board for the very first time. Obviously, I don't know the full depth of its work but I knew that was the main component of the computer. My brother, seeing all these I do ask me what I wanted to become and I replied to him that I want to be an IT personnel.                He enrolled me in a place where I was an apprentice to a hardware engineer in late 2012, that was when my IT journey started. I learned a couple of things there and after my two years term, I was released to work outside with the knowledge I already have, at first it wasn't easy as I will be encountering issues that my boss did not mention in printer repair and a lot more but I ensured that I fixed all the issues, and at every milestone, I celebrate.                 I went into networking in 2017 when I started an internship program at a company in Ibadan, Nigeria. My internship was supposed to last for a year but in the 7th month, I was promoted to be a full staff. And I started self-study using "coursera.org", I learned the fundamentals of network. I continued all, and in 2021 I started the google It support certification program, I finished and got my certificate in September 2021 and I started web development there-after.</p>
